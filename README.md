# VBA-Project
This Visual Basic code analyzes the stock data on 3 sheets in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file to calculate
 - yearly change
 - percentage increase/decrease
 - total volume
 
In addition, this code looks for the stock with the greatest yearly
 - increase in value
 - decrease in value
 - total volume traded.
 
 To use this .vba code, copy it and paste it into a new macro in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file, and re-save as a .xlsm file. When running the code, it may take a minute or two to complete. Be patient
 
 Note: Once vba code is added to Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file, it will be too large to keep in source controll
 
 Note2: Images added to the repo to show results of .vba code working.
